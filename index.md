# Welcome to PN Green. 
### Transparency, taste & trade

PN Green is a coffee sourcing company founded in 2016 and based in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

PN Green is founded on the goal to connect producers looking for stable prices and partnerships and roasters looking for opportunities to build relationships with good people producing good coffee.

Our ambition is to source, import and distribute tasty coffee with an underlying commitment to supporting long-term relationships, economic stability, environmental awareness, and positive social impact in the communities we source coffee from.

We buy green coffee from people we know and trust. We work with farmers and exporters in six countries: 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Brazil, Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia. We sell coffee to European roasters who share our values.
